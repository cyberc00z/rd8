description: Immortality is the greatest thing ever.

***Yu'all lost in the city of sci-blocks***
Mixing and mastering all the beats to beat your younger self
But nothing works when you sleeps with stan 
Because he doesn't pardon your lies
even there is no button to minimize
Apprently, I was thrown , Adhrit reached at some height
But in reality he cann't survive 
So with all dignity he must die
Mircales wouldn't happen when one's dead
now it's code work to walk from graves
mortals tell you nothing
because they are woke. 

There is no question left for soul loser
who can't see through the mist
all accept my pardon
I was such a waste
Rejected, Unexpected, brutally murdered and paralaysed
breathing chemicals and wearing salions 
protest against one's mind
hormons you can't resist
aren't motive of intellect
price must be paid whether with soul or chirs
Oh! damn, I can't see with my eyes
I need to prepare a little
mostly via magic and spell
don't become another prostitute
neither fuck your hands or another soul
love never found
or my lover died in pendamic
all subject of my mind
I know I am nothing
But I know hole is the greatest thing ever to find.

Pournig the dust into ditch
body not accepting smokes and wines
I think I need to quit
Don't pardon me for my deeds
I deserve more pain
more pain enough to mesmerize
I hope no one will find my dark secret.
You are a lie, a persona of bribe
I am robotman with sting penis in size
Clouds will come and give me place
i guess messiah has arrived!!
