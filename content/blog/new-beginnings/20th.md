description: Immortality is the greatest thing ever.

***Yu'all lost in the city of sci-blocks***
<br />
Mixing and mastering all the beats to beat your younger self
<br />
But nothing works when you sleeps with stan 
<br />
Because he doesn't pardon your lies
even there is no button to minimize
<br />
Apprently, I was thrown , Adhrit reached at some height
<br />
But in reality he cann't survive 
So with all dignity he must die
<br />
Miracles wouldn't happen when one's dead
now it's code work to walk from graves
mortals tell you nothing
because they are woke. 

There is no question left for soul ^^loser!!
who can't see through the mist
all accept my pardon
I was such a waste
<br />
Rejected, Unexpected, brutally murdered and paralaysed
breathing chemicals and wearing salions 
<br />
protest against one's mind
hormons you can't resist
<br />
aren't motive of intellect
price must be paid whether with soul or chirs
<br />
Oh! damn, I can't see with my eyes
<br />
I need to prepare a little
mostly via magic and spell
don't become another prostitute
<br />
neither fuck your hands or another soul
love never found
<br />
or my lover died in pendamic
all subject of my mind
I know I am nothing
<br />
But I know hole is the greatest thing ever to find.


Pournig the dust into ditch
body not accepting smokes and wines
<br />
I think I need to quit
Don't pardon me for my deeds.
<br />
I deserve more pain
more pain enough to mesmerize.
<br />
I hope no one will find my dark secret.
<br />
You are a lie, a persona of bribe
I am robotman with sting penis in size
<br />
Clouds will come and give me place
i guess messiah has arrived!!
