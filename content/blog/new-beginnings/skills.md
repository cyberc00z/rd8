“Man often becomes what he believes himself to be. If I keep on saying to myself that I cannot do a certain thing, it is possible that I may end by really becoming incapable of doing it. On the contrary, if I have the belief that I can do it, I shall surely acquire the capacity to do it even if I may not have it at the beginning."  ― Mahatma Gandhi

"People rant choices; up to the ground,
Please Play fairly.

One of the serious problems with me, I expect others to be hundred percent authentic with me while playing the game. But I have to understand, these people are coming out of schools like MIT, Standford, Cambridge, Columbia, Harvard, Yale, etc. If they don't have enough skills in the field they will simply be got hired because of their School names.
This makes me sick.
Perhaps, Change make comes from nowhere but it's time to win over nature. Not over people. The time where people have power over people has gone. 
Blockchain is the first step in this direction, where only skills win.
But do I have enough skills to win over nature. 
"Nope", then how are you gonna change this?
Just have work from today. Maybe it's the calling for me. My habits have to be abandon now and I have come over the hill on the top of the world not with words but with nature, meta-skills, and winning.
Well, we have to see the world from the highest point in the universe, but not alone but with humanity. 
This year giving me a nice blowjob of never getting a winning test in life or I'll die poorly on the street somewhere like a dog. It's just terrible for me to think only 100 days more left in this year. And 2022 will be on the gate.

And I will same as before, just a useless piece of sand on the earth.
I was dependent on a fool, whom I thought to understand the nature of startup, money, and technology but he was just a  pivot of foolishness and stupidity. Maybe, I am suffering from lung cancer or I will die this year but I have to overcome because I am not unworthy, I am not the moron who just masturbate and I am not the one who doesn't understand nature. I will end men's quest for the understanding universe. I'll zoom out and zoom in on the galaxy. I know, I am late, But I know, I am the seventh great man.
 I owe to win. I am the pioneering point of the great unavoidable revolution. I am chosen by the great creator of the universe."
                     
This deep depression has unleashed something upon him. His eyes are now like a drunken dog. Alexandr Clark knows what he was saying loudly to the clouds.
And he fell asleep on the footpath near the Planet firm.
