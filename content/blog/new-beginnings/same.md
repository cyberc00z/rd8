I reached at the tip;
<br>
without a sip,
<br>
hoping for my expectations;
<br>
nonetheless proceeding paranoid.
<br>
<hr>

Tonight's light is amazing, 
<br>
But morning is superfluous..
<br>
I hope for thee same response.
<br>
Being the same,
<br>
Living your life in my spectacles..
<br>
But like tasting my own spices.
<br>
<hr>

Living our life on other's memories,
<br>
stories or like && dislike.
