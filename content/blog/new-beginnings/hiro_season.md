A Report of 2 pages got printed my Dang and flush out in front of Dr. Sinha's Table. 
"Alxes Clark , weight 70 kg , O+ve , found pneumoconiosis ", buzzing Dang added , "Do you want me to read Complete Report Sir ? "
"No need , Go and get me a Xpan", replied Dr.
"ok sir", said Dang. And start moving towards door of checkup room. 
Alxender was sitting on chair besides door. When he listened Dang to saying about pneumoconiosis , he does not understand clearly. After all Dang is a robot special neural networks which are trained in field of medical science and assisting doctors. 
"come ahead", said Dr. Sinha, nodding his eyes towards Alxender.
Alxender get up from chair and moved towards Doctor. 
"This is the big problem with uneducated peoples like you , who hides their anything from their doctors", said Dr.
Alxender remains slient.
"You said , your parents were not working in mines and you were their for only one year", said Dr. Sinha with a irritation in his voice.
"Yes, sir", replied Alxender with a clear voice.
"But you got Pneumoconiosis", said Dr. Sinha wideing his arm and giving a gesture of fool.
"What that means Dr., I don't understand", said Alxender.
"It's a lung disease", said Dr. Sinha who is trying to raise himself up against his chair. "If you are working in mines since last year then how could you be diagnoised with pneumoconiosis" added Dr. Sinha, moving toward windows of his room.
"So what? What is relational between my disease and mines", gribbled Alxender with little red face.
"It's a defect of working in coal mines. Pneumoconiosis is also known as Black Lungs. It is commonly found in coal mine workers who were working in mines for a long time of their lives, but you are just 21 , how can you be? And as you said, your parents never worked in mines. `Then how can you be diagnose with something like black lungs in just one year.`"
Alxender who was looking staring at blank glass of water on doctor's table, heard about black lungs before. But he didn't said anything to Dr. Sinha. He remained silent just staring below on water glass. 

"May I come in, Sir", a robi voice coming in from the door of room.
"*Come In*", replied Dr. Sinha in a loathen way.
