"*Cappuccino! small red mug, Table 0.45*", shouted man on counter.
<br />
A Young man in his early twenties raised his hand across counterman. He smell like a bum. Old suicidle jacket with Cyberpunk stickers and mining boots with a gay smile on his face, this man is Alxender Clarrk. He used to work on lunar city xx0ms in Space Expedition, a planet's mining company. He came to Spancer for a *cronic surgery* of his mind. Cronic Surgery is kind of a  meditiation and way to acheive mindfullness for mining servicemans. Every year a million people from all over the `milkyway` came to Spancer for various medical treatments and in search of other great things which only exist on greatest planet of measurable *Knotor* (known universe).

Alxender often feels sudden and deliberate attacks of anxiety. Though he prefers to drink milky things in red mugs because other mugs which exists on xx0ms and Spancer's cities are give him a temprament of losing something. And also red mugs are the cheapest ones.

"Proceeding 244 degree right - 32.3 degree left , target label 0.45, cupon name :   Alxender Clark",fuzzing Tobby.
Tobby steel body cann't move fast between the iron tables but he is faster than any human. When Alxender touch his mug , he liked the warmth of it. When he received mug and return token message in his phone. He thanked Tobby. 
<br />
"It's my pleasure Mr. Clark, !Hope you like Our Service ", said Gray Machine which is standing before his table.
He chuckled on Tobby's complements.
<br />
"When do you think I can return to xx0ms ?", asked Alxender.
<br />
"In 420 hours ", replied Dr. Sinha.
<br />
Dr. Sinha is a tall man with less hair on his head. He currently examining condition of Alxender's nervous system and doing his analysis if he need a neural surgery or just cronic meditiation would be enough.

A Report of 2 pages got printed my Dang and flush out in front of Dr. Sinha's Table. 
"Alxender Clark , weight 70 kg , O+ve , found pneumoconiosis ", buzzing Dang added , "Do you want me to read Complete Report Sir ? "
<br />
"No need , Go and get me a Xpan", replied Dr.
<br />
"ok sir", said Dang. And start moving towards door of checkup room. 
<br />
Alxender was sitting on chair besides door. When he listened Dang to saying about pneumoconiosis , he does not understand clearly. After all Dang is a robot special neural networks which are trained in field of medical science and assisting doctors. 
<br />
"come ahead", said Dr. Sinha, nodding his eyes towards Alxender.
Alxender get up from chair and moved towards Doctor. 
<br />
"This is the big problem with uneducated peoples like you , who hides their anything from their doctors", said Dr.
Alxender remains slient.
<br />
"You said , your parents were not working in mines and you were their for only one year", said Dr. Sinha with a irritation in his voice.
<br />
"Yes, sir", replied Alxender with a clear voice.
<br />
"But you got Pneumoconiosis", said Dr. Sinha wideing his arm and giving a gesture of fool.
<br />
"What that means Dr., I don't understand", said Alxender.
<br />
"It's a lung disease", said Dr. Sinha who is trying to raise himself up against his chair. "If you are working in mines since last year then how could you be diagnoised with pneumoconiosis" added Dr. Sinha, moving toward windows of his room.
<br />
"So what? What is relational between my disease and mines", gribbled Alxender with little red face.
<br />
+"It's a defect of working in coal mines. Pneumoconiosis is also known as Black Lungs. It is commonly found in coal mine workers who were working in mines for a long time of their lives, but you are just 21 , how can you be? And as you said, your parents never worked in mines. `Then how could someone be diagnose with something like black lungs in just one year.`"
<br />
Alxender who was looking staring at blank glass of water on doctor's table, heard about black lungs before. But he didn't said anything to Dr. Sinha. He remained silent just staring below on water glass. 
<br />
"May I come in, Sir", a robi voice coming in from the door of room.
<br />
"*Come In*", replied Dr. Sinha in a loathal way.

Under a dull dark night , Alex moving around a bumper boof town of spancer.
He was walking without any purpose , without any desire.

Pros and Cons choosing, making a decision and other thoughts which were dwelling inside his head.
He was never afraid of death or never scared of any injury then why our hiro is just wondering in a shock when he knew that he will die or barely able to carry the burden of life. He always wants to come spancer since age of 17. To work here, being a engineer or an enterpurner. But his luck never favoured him. But hiro isn't a believer of luck. He always feels a hidden part in himself, full of life-energy , full of engineering perspective and full of winning. But he never able to switch on his hidden personality as default.


Characteristic such as Infinite Intelligence, Madness and Boldness in only mind, that's all he wants from himself but always procastination and his poor results took him down.

When Alex thought of getting flight again to xx0ms, he felt insane amount of guilt. Guilt for not being on death road but for not utilizing his life as he wanted , for giving up soon, for not trying until things pass in this favour. He felt like somebody is pricking needles in his forehead. 

" Do you want ? " , a man asked.
<br />
"yes..", replied Alex.
<br />
"only 40K boy, she will be yours for life.
<br />
He chuckled badly on word life.
He is outside of only remained brothel where still real human girls came for who got scamed on the name of virgnity auction. 
Other brothel shifted to Virutal Cams and other mixed reality companies. No body watches porn now. 
<br />
"Now-a-days some teenagers tryin' to take over gibbie kiddo ", owner of brothel said, "they're just some  script kiddies with random exploits ." added the owner.
<br />
Alex didn't gave him any response . He was sitting there on a chair , staring at girls who were standing in front of him. He was not looking at everyone but only staring into eyes of *R0xana*.
When R0x find herself on nook of 5'10 guy , who was giving her all his attention.
<br />
"hey look at him", a girl on spot 3 said.
<br />
"he is staring at this new girl who got less attractive figure.", said another.
<br />
"OK, we fix it. boy" said the Owner.
<br />
He ordered all girls to go back to their rooms expect R0x, who was just trying her best to ignore Alex.

"R0xana Sharma from Earth1 ", shouted the owner , " bidding with this kiddo named `Alexender Clarrk` ", added the owner.
<br />
"Please both of you , came here and sign", said the lawyer of brothel.
Alex who is now thinking of his life ending in one month and about his penis, came to Table and signed following R0x. 
While this whole process of selling girls was happening since 2154, when majority of males starting to date their AI girlfriends. 

<br />

"Ah..  want to drink Beer!!", said R0x.
<br />
When Alex heared her sweet voice he was not surprised. He already know , who she was and what she is doing here?
<br />
"huh...." , replied Alex.
<br />
"Are you from `Eath1`" , asked R0x.
<br />
"ye..", whispered Alex.
<br />
"Is there still any chance of mine to go back ?", said R0x.
<br />
After some seconds when she didn't hear any reply, she turned back and found that Alex is on a wine shopping. Soon he came back to her and haned her beer cane.
They started walking again.
"Still don't drink", asked R0x.
"nah..", replied Alex who waved his hand toward her to cross the road. 
<br />
"you  gotta place here!", said R0x, "why you came to Spancer , for me ?", added R0x.
Alex remained slient and trying to open door of his apatment.
