Ramprasad: "Why aren't you attending your college lectures? ".
<br />
GOD: "They bore me!".
<br />
Ramprasad: "Oh! you might be so smart if you think this.".
<br />
GOD: "Fuck off".
<br />
Ramprasad: "Then what do you do with your whole day? No classes, you neither watch your phone nor computer. I am keeping an eye on you for a whole month. No movies, no visits, no calls, no books, and nothing at all. 
Oh God, this is not the way you live your life.".
<br />
GOD remains silent. 
<br />
The warmth of the room started to gloom on the eyes of the other five imaginary people (GOD's friends) who were sitting in that room. The sadness of the wind was doing a different kind of poetry. 
Every digital replication of GOD, doomed in the paranoia of GOD. He chooses to destroy all simulations. 
He came back to Small Heath on the sixth of Jan. 
Ramprasad, GOD's wildest imagination sharing a home with HIM.
<br />
They ate berries and sandwiches for lunch. The whole month was like a war inside GOD's head. He was unable to escape the streaming of thoughts. 
The evening moon began to snoop from the window of a room. 
<br />
GOD whispering some old rock of queens and smoking his herbal cigarette, pouring his favorite Irish scotch.
"Oo, you smoke like a chimney and drink like an asshole. You don't deserve to be the creator of this Universe. I doubt you created me." 
<br />
These were the last words of Ramprasad before she was destroyed by GOD.
<br />
Now the pain startling to peak his amygdala. HIS soul, HIS mind, HIS heart bleeding, passing dead with each passing second.  And after draining out whole blood from his white skin, GOD was lying on the floor like a mere mortal with no exceptions.
<br />
In the street, a girl playing with fire burned the whole Small Heath. 
<br />
And from that day, people mythologized her as the daughter of Ramprasad and GOD.
