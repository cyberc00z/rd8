Chronological events are the consequence of human actions in the time frame of space.
<br />
People tend to believe in destiny. But I don't.
<br />
A meditation on the past doesn't change anything except for connecting the dots. "One who struggles will be famous.". 
<br />
But who the fuck works for being famous or well known. Most exceptional works, which are coming out of history, take place only for ultimate wisdom beyond the human mind.
<br />
In my view, India is a terrible country for people who want to discover life through the lenses of Science and Technology. I don't know what ISRO's scientists think of life though they are doing interim work to satisfy their politically rich national leaders.
<br />
While growing up here, in an abusive, intense surrounding is very hard to develop an explorer mind.
<br />
Look at this,  My Parents, My  Uncles, My Neighbours have already declared me as an example for their children to not become like me. 
<br />
Because I refused to prepare for any government services job. Why should I participate in their foolishness when I don't want to be like them. I have never dreamed of being someone who doesn't want to do their work but wants a government job for money and status security.
<br />  
It's hurt my mind, my confidence, and my values. Why these people don't think in terms of work, value, good for society and welfare of mankind.
<br />
We all are animals, fucking status-seeking junkies who live on the planet of earth. 
<br />
"Who are you?",
<br />
"Who are you?".
<br /> 
After some seconds, I was staring into the darkness and chaos, shouted again, "Who are you?". No reply came back.
<br />
Life often hits you hard, knockout out you where nobody cares about you and thinks of you as life long loser. You feel left out, you remain unnoticed while the least talented person in your eyes gets the reward.
<br />
Then you often ask yourself, "Who are you?".
<br />
Your Definition of truth, the prime value of your life startling to mingle around your expenses and forces you to live on pizza and welfare. For your love and meals of your kids, you'll start tinkering around ideas that irritated you in past. You left those ideas or things in back in days because they are dilution of your personality. Now those guttery things are in front of you and asked you, "Who are you?" 
<br />
I don't have three stories about lifelike Steve Jobs.
But I am willing to work hard to make my apple.

Update : 08-08-2021
<br />
Still nothing changing , same feeling , same anxiety and same days. The taut of beign useless and can't do anything everyday.
Stop complaning kid and start doing shit. Oh really , you old motherfucker. You are not going to win like this.
<br />
People speaking of great leaders and engineers and it's so shamefull of me that I am still failing in everything.
<br />
I left alone and behind. People won.
<br />
Why am I failing in things those I chose for myself? Nobody reply to my emails and other shits. Everybody just going ahead and I lost in this wave.
<br />
Over the past 3 years, I have seen many github accounts, Why these people. Because they accepted things simply as they were. Or I am just weak. Not enough intelligent or something god loves me more than others.
Please give me a chance, please help me , please let me nameshake, please , please. 
<br />
I am burden on my parents, I overgrown moron who is just shit .
I can't write it anymore. I have to do something with this feeling. Everyday making me more furstated with myself, this self hate is just consuming my body. And I became a skeleton. 
<br />
I am not able to purchase a single peice of cloth for myself. I have written over 1000 emails to professors and enturpurners but most of them didn't reply. Job vaccancies asked you for Degree which I don't have. Neither Degree nor money or skills to earn money(if not have money). 
<br /> 
Yes! this is losing, And it's a life of losing.
Since Childhood , I was bright in studies , I did everything what i expected to do yet only my sins are giving me returns.
I always thought my life would like a great engineer or super-hero or scientist but nothing came along. Three years in a row. My best friend laughed at my face. Everybody left me. 
<br />
I often thought why some people have so linear path and  they succeed in life. I am not denying that fact that they put hard work every day. So also I did. But they succeed, Some people got very lucky. Like my cousion.
Some people got like elon musk mind. They are just winners. Some are like me, who just lose. Even I have read book related to growth psycology. Even practicing, book's rule does not change my mindset in one year.
Because money didn't came. I am not able find a bug in website. I don't so called hacker found them now-a-days but finding bug like IDOR , XSS and open redirect feels so boring. 
<br />
Neither I am able to concentrate on programming nor on reading anything.
I rejected every relationship and other pleasures most of my life with the exception of 2018 which was a year of sins, i fucked up every where. BharatX startup rejected me after interview because they thought I don't have clarity in speaking and ideas. Or my project are not good enough. Advised me to learn from courseara which is good.
<br />
I want to go outside and win.
