Chronological events are the consequence of human actions in the time frame of space.
<br />
People tend to believe in destiny. But I don't.
<br />
A meditation on the past doesn't change anything except for connecting the dots. "One who struggles will be famous.". 
<br />
But who the fuck works for being famous or well known. Most exceptional works, which are coming out of history, take place only for ultimate wisdom beyond the human mind.
<br />
In my view, India is a terrible country for people who want to discover life through the lenses of Science and Technology. I don't know what ISRO's scientists think of life though they are doing interim work to satisfy their politically rich national leaders.
<br />
While growing up here, in an abusive, intense surrounding is very hard to develop an explorer mind.
<br />
Look at this,  My Parents, My  Uncles, My Neighbours have already declared me as an example for their children to not become like me. 
<br />
Because I refused to prepare for any government services job. Why should I participate in their foolishness when I don't want to be like them. I have never dreamed of being someone who doesn't want to do their work but wants a government job for money and status security.
<br />  
It's hurt my mind, my confidence, and my values. Why these people don't think in terms of work, value, good for society and welfare of mankind.
<br />
We all are animals, fucking status-seeking junkies who live on the planet of earth.
