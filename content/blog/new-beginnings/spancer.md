**Afeter 5 days of starting:**

2. Problems with firebase auth flow and it's slow not like on click response
3. Not much progressive results.

Got pain eye drop, trying to open my eyes.

Decided to start all over with android studio then use react-native-firebase library.
and create a django server with recommandation system.
