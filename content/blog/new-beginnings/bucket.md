# Notes 

It is incredibly humbling for me to witness how the ideas I unconsciously logged years ago or envisioned in stories are now becoming realities in today's world.
<br />
I used to daydream about owning a car that could change its color at the push of a button, and now BMW is making it happen using electronic ink technology.
<br />
Back when I was around 8 or 9 years old, I had no knowledge of the anime series Naruto, yet I found myself writing remarkably similar stories out of thin air. I only discovered Naruto in March 2021 and was surprised to find that it shared the same power arcs as some of the lion stories I had written.
<br />
Throughout all the ups and downs in my life, I have always sought to uncover the essential truth of life, the concept of God. I believe that technology and science offer the best means to understand the creator. It may sound clich√©, but it's true. If we can create something that can self-replicate and thrive, if we can develop a pinnacle of genius capable of rendering entire worlds in seconds, then we would have found God.
<br />
Lately, I've found myself evading job interviews and realizing that I don't want to work for established organizations as of now. I will try to find out some interesting missions or companies/startups now and ping them for work. Instead, I aspire to dismantle the current school system, as I believe its downfall is inevitable. The time we've all been waiting for is approaching.
<br />
This year, I am determined to try out various endeavors, to delve into a multitude of experiences and ideas. The weight of these thoughts has become suffocating, and I fear living with regret if I don't manifest them in the practical world. It would be deeply unfair and dishonest to myself.
<br /> 

Seriously, I am coming back to technology after two years of gap. So A LOT to cover on. Hail LLaMa
