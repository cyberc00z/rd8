# ***Winning***

                                                                                     ***[  I  ]***

***Race fast in your mind,  how you want brain and success bind.***

***Near possession of knowledge, I think it’s time to recalled,***

***What I imagined , why all this started,***

***Why choose the path of solitude,***

***Why I departed from world***

***What I want to be, is the question of novelty.***

                                                                                       ***[  II  ]***

***Keep priorities first listen,***

***In the game of soul, making contributions nil.***

***To heavy air of desert, from happy air of seashore***

***For the bronze age mental posture,***

***To the point on which happiness can’t be captured***

***Listening to great many podcasts,*** 

***To detoxing all substances from my mind***

***To all sacrifices , all honors, all gambling***

***we only desire for winning.***

                                                                                        ***[   III  ]***

***What is winning, and why you want to win?***

***Is there any great reason?***

***Notary with cultivate session,*** 

***Vanity in all over recession,***

***Inflation between you and your passion,*** 

***you might need some succession,***

***There is where you caught up with winning.***

***Winning***

                                                                                                                                                                               

                                                                                    ***[ IV ]*** 

***For all the mornings , I’d spent on cycles***

***To catch up with top faces in my mind***

***wait , were they really brilliant people?***

***or it was just me making them whatever they were?***

***I don’t know, I still dream about them,***

***think of all them like gem with cream,***

***and myself a unbaked bread,*** 

***measured everything through classes grades.***

***It was totally stupidity or time’s crudity,***

***Please somebody save me with this insanity.***

***In nights I’m passing god with perfection , I see lights in reflections.***

***Five years of misery, gifted me this curiosity.***

***This was starting, that was winning.***

***Winning***

                                                                                        ***[  V  ]***

***Umm white page, makes me feel like kept in a cage..***

***Got this instinct into my bones,***

***If I’d not read for days,***

***My existence loses it’s weights.***

***For all the mornings, where I ride the bicycle,***

***The dreams I knitted in those early spans,***

***The chatters of night angles is still in my mind***

***I see myself exerting my rides,***

***With water on my sights.***

***Felt that road calling me this morning,***

***Life gives you bumpers without warning.***

***I see why I did whatever I did?***

***Was there any specific goal?***

***That I want to achieve or it was just mockery of time,***

***With the burning desire to castle my prime.***

***Now I think it all was pretty useless,***

***Because It all went wrong from many places***

***But I still dreams of jewels,***

***Not made of gold or metals***

***But from unshattered manhood and battles.***

***How the battle of mount Zemaraim won by the King,***

***Think ,act and evolve thoughts of winning.***

***Winning***

                                                                               ***[ VI ]***

***I was 19 , when my parents left me,***

***Because my behaviour was to absurd for normal humans.***

***Early glimpse of everyday’s sun,***

***Reminds me of normal life,***

***And I always look on the bright side of my hands,***

***To abolish the whole acquaintance.***

***Self doubt , little bit of proud and procrastination,***

***Drown me to the lowest point of manifestation.***

***Apparently it became a pattern,***

***Which I will crack with disruption.***

***I haven’t done yet, there is still some time,***

***O god damn! why I think winning is mine.***

***Winning***

                                                                         ***[ VII ]***

***Demons startled to slave me***

***I cried if is there anybody to***

***save me?***

***I suffixed all the charity,***

***With the purpose of mindful therapy.***

***Huge combat to transcend mediocrity.***

***But was I ready make it reality,***

***There was still imperfection in my soul, heart,***

***“How to do it”was the only question I asked.***

***How to do it!!!!***

***Do remember when you used to be top of the herd?***

***With low efforts and bad handwriting excel in every competition.***

***It is symbol of swindle, saving you from swapping kindles;***

***Protest against yourself in order to proceed,***

***Yourself is the only one who stops to succeed.***

***Failures are reminiscent of where I wanna go, what I used to be,***

***And what I had to become in this endless journey.***

***Winning!!***
