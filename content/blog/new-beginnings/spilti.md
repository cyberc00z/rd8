"Jinsei wa, umi ni dete shizumu bōto ni ashi o fumiireru yōna monodesu."
<br /> 
means "Life is like stepping onto a boat which is about to sail out to sea and sink.".
<br />
I was 17 when I read "The Way of Zen.". It left me unaffected in physical way but my changed neurochemistry in whole different aspects.
<br />
My parents were worried because I never traveled alone before. But I decided to go Spiti Valley then how could I step back? It was the first moment of my life to confess that I have grown up in a very unmatured fashion. The adrenaline of youth was running through my brain. I remembered the propellant coldness of the environment on my body and my quest to discover the wisdom of monkhood, which never left me since my visit to Tabo Monastery. 
Morning shines and winter nights from the monastery of Tabo Monastry seem like a dream for wisdom.
I was scheduled for a morning class, " How to Control Mind. ". which was difficult for me.
<br />
At 11:00 am, after the meditation of three hours, here begins the new responsibility to take care of the monastery's cleanliness. I was never expecting the number of people who came to visit the house (which was now my house also) of some monks.
<br />
Then carefully understanding their accents and guiding each of the tourists to every part of our house. 
<br />
After having some fruits in meal, everybody was free to do meditation and study anywhere in large halls. Few first days, I was only carefully trying to observe how they read and think.
