Let's see what comes in last two weeks of May 2021.
I am acutally thinking making a online dairy on this website where i will reflect on my every day work and other things. That will be great and making it public gives me a edge. :(

If i did something like online dairy then have i need to change this website design or something. I don't think so. 
 I'll try to do it again.
 I have tried some sort of journaling last year for 2-3 months. 
 Ok.
 Here we go...

Go lange is great but C is mother fucking great.

Instead of writing daily record I will write my findings and work so it will help me keep watch over my body and mind.
