Ok?

"You can't go home back, child,", said the Peachtree spirit.

"But Why?" asked the child.

"Because you didn't stop your family to destroy the orchard."

This was the first time when I see real art in the form of filmmaking.

It was the autumn of 2016, the movie was Dreams, directed by Akira Kurosawa. I was amazed how can somebody claim that he used to see these dreams repeatedly in his life span. This was the beginning of my learning about Japan, Writing, and Thinking. 

However, as time goes I starting writing articles for local newspapers. 
As from the advice of Akira, I started reading literature in my spare time.

Nagirowon Woods is my favorite book. But my destiny is to want something different from me.

It was October 2019, When I wrote my first python program.
A simple "Hello World " program. With, now I can see maps of the world, the calculation which helps the universe to operate.

Until I worked in many startups to learn about different technology. Most of them were doing the same kind of things, but it doesn't matter for a teenager like me because for me they are doing something. As anyone can predict, until 2030, the World gonna change completely. Humanity is going to face revolutions on every side together which will change humans' life forever. 

AI Revolution; - which is kind of already here, but it will become more clear with brain-computer interfaces and modeling.

Bio-Tech; - genetics, overall computing new bread of human extension and a high-value investment in agriculture.

Transportation; - as space travel coming near with Virgin Space flights and Spacex, Air taxi and high-speed AI-enabled trains with kind of slam mapping. 

Holography; - have you seen that javascript project, which claims to make a screen like science-fiction. But when It came to real-life production, most ventures are going to use C++ with hardware.  Imagine Zoom meeting now.

Space colonization; - Most exciting part of our decade. Oh! god, why I am not an astronaut right now. No need to write it here. Already great men from the '70s and '80s are working on it.

BlockChain; - last but not least. 

Nevertheless, I want to work on every technology. But I want to start with Air Taxi, AI, BCI, and Electrifying the world. 

It is a fantasy talk but these are the fantasies that are my source of continuing with days. 
As Steve Jobs said, 
" If you can think that you can change things then you will not be the same as before. " 
We have a map of the difference between 2021-2030.
