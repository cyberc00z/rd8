The search for meaning.
As quoted by me, "your work should be meaningful.".
I read the men from mars section from the book was clearly stating the men from the 20'th century incentivized great work in physics, chemistry, and other applied science. Now, looking at my days, it's just frustration, boredom, and failure of a man. People around don't understand that we are going under the great revolution.
This universe is a timeless, endless loop. It is always going under evolution.
There was plenty of them, but only some chosen to be called, "men from mars".
What will my three stories of life? I have to write it better than anyone or I have to learn how to write in this process.  

life, learn, lost.
