#### Petals

Forgive me , I can't stay all night in your dreams,
<br />
Watching your rose petals with mournful beams,
<br />
God of Time requesting me to endure more and more,
<br />
thou spirits cheering with diabolic reems.

<br />

As I see more of you, 
<br />
we came together on bed of cosmos
<br />
Dancing through lives and deaths,
<br />
Adjoining stars and moons
<br />
We are becoming  thyself,
losing ourselves. 

<br />

Your lewdness, your curls, your scent, your enigma 
<br />
all burning suns.
<br />
I can't let you vanish in deep forest of galaxies,
<br />
promised to your alluring womanhood.

<br />

Thou, Sun has cut out my throat,
<br />
So I can't speak.
<br />
Magnetic pearls plunging from your eyes,
<br />
are symbols of Saturn's grieves,
<br />
Forgive me, herra , if i can’t speak.

<br />

Blue suite and  cheeze songs,
<br />
All explode fires in metals,
<br/>
Keels , vampires and matters,
<br />
I love to feel your Petals.

<br />

Likewise Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy,
<br />
our chemistry as Sherlock and Moriarty.
<br />
We can seperate but can't die different.
<br />
Nonetheless, life without you, doesn't matter.

<br />

Like forest gump, you runs in my mind
<br />
without you , the universe is blind.
<br />
Your white spirit, your petals redolence, your moving tilts
<br />
can shrug agonies of god's world.

<br />

Grace, Juliet and Jane all neath you,
<br />
You are bewildering fire of my heart. 
<br />
You are Mery’s favourite petal. 
<br />
Come and disdain my pain,
<br/>
My petal, I am here, recumbencing on Eve’s puddle.

<br />
End!! 

I just kept imaging, we walking in Boston streets with cold deadly breeze.
The sparkling sunshine, decorating lavendar petals lying on roadside puddles and if somebody noticed us standing there, we would be the freaks just roaming there.
