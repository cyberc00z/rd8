Like a fire to burn,
<br>
World around you.
<br>
You forget everything for merely for size.
<br>
Drink like drinker
<br>
Goes alike light
<br>
Partying like pros
<br>
Fucking like stars
<br>
Beautiful like Prague 
<br>
You became Stubborn.
<br>
But it's hard like rock,
Awesome like me.
<br>
Wherever you shuffle it,
<br>
Left,Right,Up and Down.
<br>
Besides a smelly Milk;
<br>
Goes in your nose,
<br>
You muffle it without any care.
<br>
Then we just want to erase it,
<br>
from our memory , space and time.
