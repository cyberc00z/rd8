###### i^
Conquering the whole;
<br>
Therefore; i digged the grave.
<br>
Cause, once charm would vanished;
<br>
Nobody,will save.
<br>

###### ii^
Too though highest , climb of charisma.
<br>
Because i am coming for you.
<br>
My blood is sucked by sights;
<br>
My bones are erosed by hights,
<br> 
My flesh became food for Earth;
<br>
And, my breath absorbed by wind.
<br>
But now, i am coming for you!
<br>

###### iii^

My will to be 24 carat gold,
<br>
NikTek wants to me sold.
<br>
By the man with long hairs;
<br>
In black dress who appears in my dream.
<br>
Now, it's my determine path which will;
<br>
Stunning for Earth to Universe and next star become a sole.
