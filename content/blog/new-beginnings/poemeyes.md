###### Phase - +0

Your Sleepy Eyes;
<br>
        Have a gathering shine,
<br>Which polarized me;<br>to make a boundary between us.<br>Every brow of your soft skin,<br>shuffles us to sun.
<br>Making successful nights;<br>Despite a lot of bad mornings together,<br>Together; like the herd of monkies.<br>We wondererd everytime;<br>Nor for pray<br>Neither for being pray. <br>We just waited for injustify;<br>"Oh! you painted out tears of mine",<br>shivering in snowy evening <br>drunk by you.<br>Because Your sleepy eyes;<br>They just make me felt alive.

> <span>It is ok if you don't understand any thing of these lines</span> 

###### Phase - 0

We've borrowed sorrow together;
<br> but I'm borrowing your's part for my-self.
<br>
Because your sleepy eyes;
<br>They curse me too hard die.

###### Phase - -0
Feeling fraction of reusing, 
True lies infront of world.
<br>I am really
tired , And you don't want to
work anymore.<br>
But we can't sleep together on bed,
Or whether in our graves.
<br>
My cold sake for you , astonshing promise of change.
<br>
To keep promise of sleep, would be stringify after our martyr.
<br>
Because your sleepy eyes;
<br>
Help! me to grow and terrify.


###### Although , EYES those are the inspiration of this typo will be attached here later. I can use her eyes picture without even knowing of her or without asking her for permission as she'll not refuse (probably). But I don't want to do any deed which  didn't felt me joyfull. So you will find those eyes soon.
You deserves a smooth Thanks if you have read this absurd poem !!
