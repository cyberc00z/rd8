#### VERSE-I

Today I took a walk, nothing special on this Diwali. Or you can say that Diwali as before. 
<br />
Pollution, Lights, Overflowing sewage and Crackers, noise and more noise with good shit smell (actually very very good). 
<br />
I walked approx 2.5 km from Shastri Nagar Metro Station to Dhaiya Boys Hostel Room No: 203. 

#### VERSE-II
<br />
I met many girls today but I didn't get attracted to anyone. 
<br />
My friend found one girl who is cheating on Saransh(my friend's roommate). It was a quiet feeling. 
<br />
No one knows us in this town. We were the freaks who were standing there. If somebody noticed us, then he/she could just say one weirdo with one human. I was trying to stop myself from saying random shit to strangers.
<br /> 
There is the fog of DELHI pollution, and I am just observing the same pattern of human begins. 

#### VERSE-III
<br />
The walk was wondering like I found every answer of craving. 
<br />
I am sure this is the same way to find permanent and scalable solutions to mental stagnation.
<br />
It might be the new module of mind. 
<br />
New puzzle.
<br />
New Discovery.
