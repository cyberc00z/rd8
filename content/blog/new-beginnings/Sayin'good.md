##### Paradigm Shift

You don't know,how much I loved you.
<br>
You don't know,how much I protected you.
<br>

You threw it all the way for someone...
<br>
You didn't even care,
<br>
cuz you, now, lov3e him.
<br>
Oh! Mr. Someone.

<br>
I day i left , you re-united with all your demons and call it paradise.
<br>
You do your drugs so you can be unafraid and
<br>
Call it pleasure while submitting to him.

<br>
The day will come you'll realize,
<br>
It wasn't all my fault, you had your own lies.
<br>
I loved you with all my heart and soul.

<br>
One chance I asked, you had to ignore.
<br>
I hope he stays up all night; so you can sleep,
<br>
I hope he gives up his happiness for your needs.
<br>
You know he loves you for your body;
<br>
and not your mind.
<br>

I hope he thinks about your future and not just his life.
<br>
Someday you will wake up and find, 
<br>
Your life is not what you had dreamed,
<br>
You blink and think about the time.
<br>
And Mr. Someone is not the man; you wanna be with,
<br>
