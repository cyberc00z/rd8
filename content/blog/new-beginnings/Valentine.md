"Other day somebody came to me and said, 
<br>
'''' well If you believe in science then you know that all attractions are biological and governs by neurotransmitters of your brain, then Why do you love someone, why are you in love with someone, don't you know that love doesn't exist or it's a human made concept''''
<br>  

and I laughed because you see the definition of word love is different for different people, some people, they just look it with red filter and said, '''' you need water to live'''', but I look it beyond right? 
<br>

So love, living with your partner(wife/girlfriend-- it's valentine special so just romantic partners included) and after living years with her or him , you realise is that over time you become intertwined with somebody (talking about your partner) else, the patterns in my brain will closely mirror my partner's persepective , it's like sometimes she finishes my sentences and I finish hers. I know excatly how she will apporach a particular thing, I know what she likes or what she dislikes , it's like you both started become One Person.
We both manage to see world through eachother's eyes, we manage to take a large part of the other's person's brain. It's sharing a seat in bus of your brain. 
Now you understand the Love."

If you know that I am a power user of reddit, I spent my a lot of time there.
There below is something from the psychedelics group on reddit, I gonna paste it down here.   

> Ego death , when you lose distinction between yourself and your environment completely.
> If you have a thought , you no longer able to realise that you had that thought, essentially you are longer present at all . And the thought just seem to be ,independent of any persona.



That is why many people who go through psychedelic experiences, they shares the feeling, one with the universe or connecting directly to the God. They feel like they are connected to some greater consciousness. They really were it, they just felt like they were because their mind functions were being inhabited. It's like the story teller (mind) shut down for a few minutes/hours. But you have to remember that you are still an individual mind experiencing stuff.

So in love , two individuals shares patterns of their minds with eachother and make some strong connections.

And off course, if you are not happy alone then don't try to be in a relationship with someone, because in most cases, you will become dependent on your partner for happiness which you should earn on your own by doing some work or anything in life, and learn how to care for yourself. Then most likely, you will become more suitable for a romantic relationship.
