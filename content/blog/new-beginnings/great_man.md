I do not know what I may appear to the world, but myself, I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary. Whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.


The first great man used to work 18 hours a day, seven days a week. 
He started his life as a higher priest of humanity at the age of 19 at trinity.
At the time, he was full of self-hate because of his past thoughts and experiences. Perhaps he became world-famous at the age of 26.
He discovered almost five secrets of the universe which made life a lot easy for others.

"What we now want is closer contact and better understanding between individuals and communities all over the earth, and the elimination of egoism and pride which is always prone to plunge the world into primeval barbarism and strife... Peace can only come as a natural consequence of universal enlightenment..."

The second Great Man comes in the picture as an intense mad persona same as First Great Man. They both have almost 90% similarity in day-to-day life.
He began his life at the age of 26. He was more insane than others. Once, he decided to read the whole library of the University of Budapest. He used to work 20 hours a day for his first year in university. After the second year, he was very disappointed with the foolishness of this world.
He was the only man in history who was able to cause a man-made storm that was seen all over Europe. He was the first one to invent wireless communication way ahead of his time.
