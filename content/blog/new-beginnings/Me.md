Life coming towards some new phases . My every belief and every thoughts now change more radically than ever.
Going through such Pain is seem incredible for some one to belief , so i don't want to someone to tell about this.
World is pretty much in bad shape right now.
People dying because of Covid-19 , Climate change happening ,Nature is being interrupted by human this time more deeply. 
Nature is crying with blood and nobody is hearing it. Advocates of Science thinks, "they have to think about universe , robots, space or other heavy topic, but nobody is hearing the voice of Nature".
I have been watching Nature's tears everyday. Most of time he complains about Good or moral persons , it is observing everything from it's existance .
When i questioned it about it's creator, Nature replied , "There is nothing like as human think. There is just a lab where some Lawrence is testing on earth." and Nature chuckled...
It made me soo curious to know  Actually how Nature thinks about all universe or how universe thinks about itself?

> Ok~

When I try to asked Nature again and again my questions about everything.
Nature replied me pretty well.
Nature described me the way , the path or the written drama.
I know when people will read this , they would think , this is bullshit. But I am saying this with my pure intellect that Nature already have every way of itself to solve evey problem but now NATURE SEND ME SOME SERECT TODAY FROM MY VENUS. They are rays precisely electromagnetic rays which show me eveything , "How Nautre or Universe thinks about itself and what we gonna do in some ears."
Nature controls our evey thought, every instinct and intuition.
What we feel , what we think  and what we gonna do is predetermined in most probable way but randomly.
So What about you , why are you writing this ?

While chatting with Nature , I have revealed my self to my every fear and every question. I have thought about everyting and most interesting thing which Nature recommands me most is Pain.

I felt Pain more than any other thing in these last 1.5 years. It just feel like someone taken everything, which you think as life, from you. So absurd, so sain, so painless painful. Every infinite paradox is resolved in my head .
I have found a person who is more beautiful than my heart. I have myself as a person. I have found my interests. I have found my key to happiness.
And my soo called Life.
