description: A Poem 
---

***Trauma never heals, as you can’t see it until tears appeals.***

***I’ve never seen burn down faces, only red therapists.***

***Ripped off, shit on couch, and never lied,*** 

***I see faces around corners in my house,*** 

***Mom’d seen red lady twice before I uprise.***

***Dogs barks in dark , gate hollowcasts whole night,***

***We don’t know what happened that night,***

***As I write this verse , feels like creative inside me died.***

***Don’t be so hard on yourself, you need doctor,***

***Enginnering’s verge are same as tenth grade geometry and protector.***

***What hurts most ?***

***Everyone flying off to dreamland, or she fled to your dreamland without you.***

***I thought off getting started tomorrow, demons hits hard me in the morning,***

***not able to get up from bed till six in evening,***

***Nor I fell asleep neither I died.***

***Every passing moment , fading off my pride.***

***I don’t take moral supplements,*** 

***Crowd passing judgments with compliments.***

***What’s wrong with this kid,***

***What will he do without societal adjustments***

***Die on roads, and living with worms***

***I’ll become the greatest god ever alive,*** 

***cause I’d planned to never die.***

***I altereted my sense with unconsciousness,*** 

***Am I Godsend or Am I God?***

***This is transformation.***
