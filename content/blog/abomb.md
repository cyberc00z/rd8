# The Boy and His Atomic-Bomb

## Quote
> "When you have an atomic bomb, you can do anything you want. The funny part is ... I have no idea what I want. If you were me -- what would you want?" -- Makoto Kido

## Personal Narrative

### Inner Reflection
This character is closest to my heart. It's the reflection of me in the truest sense. The poetry of my soul. It's a memento of me being somewhere in somebody's mind amid the grandness of life. 

### Existential Musings
It's a sign of validation from the devil. These thoughts only gave me kudos to confront the meaninglessness of every ambition. 

#### Raw Emotion
*Teri Maa Ki Chut.*

### Life's Landscape
Living in this third world, writing this blog from cyber cafe in 2024. It's a trauma. Cumulation of a thousand things, cumulation of 2000+ days of extreme loneliness.

## Dreamscape

### Ethereal Vision
I remember feeling anxiously witnessing this dream in which the goddess of grace ate my body parts in names of lust and enlightenment on a moon like planet. 

## Reflection on Loss

### Unexpected Revelation
I scolded Laxmikant a lot, said harsh things to him, especially after he scammed me out of 20k INR. 

### The Aftermath
Last night, Laxmikant died in an accident. For three hours, no one even looked at his body.

#### Final Thoughts
*It's strangeâ€”how we hold on to anger or grudges, thinking we have time to resolve them, only to be left with silence when it's too late.*

**Only the emptiness remains.**
