> "When you have an atomic bomb, you can do anything you want. The funny part is ... I have no idea what I want. If you were me -- what would you want?" -- Makoto Kido

This character is closest to my heart. It's the reflection of me in the truest sense. The poetry of my soul. It's a memento of me being somewhere in somebody's mind amid the grandness of life. 
It's a sign of validation from the devil. These thoughts only gave me kudos to confront the meaninglessness of every ambition. 


*Teri Maa Ki Chut.*


Living in this third world, writing this blog from cyber cafe in 2024. It's a trauma. Cumulation of a thousand things, cumulation of 2000+ days of extreme loneliness.

> "THE PURPOSE OF DOING THE THING IS THE THING ITSELF LARGELY"



I remember feeling anxiously witnessing this dream in which the goddess of grace ate my body parts in names of lust and enlightenment on a moon like planet. 




I scolded Laxmikant a lot, said harsh things to him, especially after he scammed me out of 20k INR. 

Last night, Laxmikant died in an accident. For three hours, no one even looked at his body.

*It's strangeâ€”how we hold on to anger or grudges, thinking we have time to resolve them, only to be left with silence when it's too late.*

**Only the emptiness remains.**
